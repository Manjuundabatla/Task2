**Thrilled to complete Task 2 in my web development journey with *#ApexPlanet*!**

This milestone focused on building two essential pages that enhance both **functionality** and **user interaction**:

* **To-Do List Page** – Designed a user-friendly interface for managing daily tasks with ease and simplicity.
* **Contact Form Page** – Developed a responsive contact form with fields for name, email, and message to ensure smooth communication.

Both pages were crafted using **HTML** and **CSS**, with attention to layout structure, mobile responsiveness, and a clean user experience.

Excited for the next phase—more features, more learning, more creativity!
